I have various questions about the code you have me:

1. What does truncation=True mean in the Tokenizer of the train_encoding?

2. What is this code doing? """
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((
    dict(train_encodings),
    train_labels
))

train_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(len(train_texts)).batch(16)
"""

3. What is this code doing? """
test_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(test_encodings)))
"""

Answer me with examples so that i can understand better.
